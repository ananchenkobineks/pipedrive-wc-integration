# PipeDrive API integration into WooCommerce subscriptions

This plugin was developed in order to connect WooCommerce Subscription plugin with PipeDrive deals via the API of the last. 

It:
- automatically synchronizes the deals in PipeDrive with WooCommerce subscriptions every N seconds (CRON);
- creates WordPress users with the information pulled from PipeDrive;
- allows those users then to make purchases on the site.
